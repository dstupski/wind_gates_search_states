# wind_gates_search_states
Repository for creating figures associated with Stupski and van Breugel 2024

# Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks necessary to recreate the figures associated with "Wind Gates Search States in Free Flight"
The current preprint can be found at: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.30.569086v2.abstract

Notebooks are written in Python 2 and 3, using standard libraries, e.g. matplotlib, pandas, numpt etc.  There is however one more unique dependency to run the notebooks as they are written.  This dependency FigureFirst, an Inkscape plugin that links figures made in jupyter notebooks directly into an inkscape .svg.  FigureFirst and its installation instructions can be found here.  https://github.com/FlyRanch/figurefirst

# Contents
This repository is meant to function as a complement to the full data hosted on Dryad here:

To run the notebooks you only need data from the following repositories hosted on Dryad: figure_first_templates, trimmed_data, trajectories_for_figures
